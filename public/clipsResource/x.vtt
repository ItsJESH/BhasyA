WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:11.000
You're wondering why I brought you all here.

00:11.000 --> 00:15.000
After all, we just had a feast.

00:15.000 --> 00:21.000
Since when does old Walter give us two feasts in a single fortnight?

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
Heh heh heh.

00:23.000 --> 00:28.000
Well, it's no good being Lord of the Riverlands if you can't celebrate with your family.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
That's what I say.

00:30.000 --> 00:44.000
I've gathered every fray who means a damn thing, so I can tell you my plans for this

00:44.000 --> 00:49.000
great house now that winter has come.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.000
But first, a toast.

00:52.000 --> 00:58.000
No more of that gourlish horse piss.

00:58.000 --> 01:01.000
This is the finest arbor gold.

01:01.000 --> 01:09.000
Proper wine for proper heroes.

01:09.000 --> 01:12.000
Sand together.

01:12.000 --> 01:22.000
Not you.

01:22.000 --> 01:31.000
I'm not wasting good wine on a damn woman.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.000
Maybe I'm not the most pleasant man.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
I'll admit it, but I'm proud of you lot.

01:38.000 --> 01:45.000
For my family, the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.000
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

01:51.000 --> 01:59.000
Brave men, all of you, but you're the woman pregnant with her babe.

01:59.000 --> 02:04.000
Cut the throat of a mother of five.

02:04.000 --> 02:08.000
Slorted your guests after inviting them into your home.

02:08.000 --> 02:16.000
But you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
No, no.

02:18.000 --> 02:21.000
That was your mistake.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
You should have ripped them all out.

02:23.000 --> 02:31.000
Loot and stem.

02:31.000 --> 02:38.000
The one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe.

03:02.000 --> 03:09.000
When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
Tell them winter came for house frame.
